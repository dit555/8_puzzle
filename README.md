# 8_puzzle
Can solve a 3 x 3 slide puzzle and easily modified to solve an n x n one. 
Also, allows you to scramble a standard puzzle or input one to solve. 
This project was made for an intro to artifical intellegence class and recieved 100% score. 
However it was coded in a huge rush beucase I procrastinated :P, and as a result there are a lot of redundancies in the code. In addition, the code is made messier by me forgetting that in linux you could just pipe the ouput ot a \*.txt file (was required for project) using a console command resulting in a convoluted mess of fstream file open/closings. 
TODO: clean up, change file writes to couts, remove the lots of redundancies.
